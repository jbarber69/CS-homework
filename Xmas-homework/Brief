A text file for a bank is stores customer details in the following manner
 
name:account number:amount
 
For example
 
Flook:0123456789:550.76
Barber:9876543210:10.43
Smith:5678901234:00.11
 
The account number is always ten digits long. Each day a transaction file of the spending/income to an account is used to update the 
customer details file. The transaction file looks like the following
 
account number:amount
 
For example
 
0123456789:-300.00
9876543210:300.50
 
This data is used to update the customer details file. So after updating with the above data, the customer details file would be
 
Flook:0123456789:250.76
Barber:9876543210:310.93
Smith:5678901234:00.11
 
Create a program which takes a customer details file and a transactions file and updates the information in the customer details file. 
Do not delete or overwrite the old file, but save the updates in a new file with the system date appended to the end of the file name.
